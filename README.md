The code was written in July 2015 with package version 0.4.2

### running the code one year later

One year later, using the latest version of `dplyr` at the time (0.5.0) the code snippet is no longer reproducible.

#### Questions
- Where and why does the code fail?
- Can you identify the difference in the two branches that is causing the difference in the computation environments?

### take away

> âœ… Using binder and fixing the snapshot of MRAN to the time the code was developed is a simple way to maintain reproducibility.

#### Bonus exercises

Sometimes, if you want to continue using your code, you might want it to track changes in dependencies.

- Can you rewrite the analysis code in the one year later environment to account for the change in the function API?
- Can you rewrite the analysis code so that it works for both versions?
